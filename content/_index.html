      What is Degrowth?
    position: 4
    data:

        <p>If you are not yet part of this community, you might wonder what degrowth is all about.</p><p>There are many ways to define it: as a social and political movement, a stream of thought, an academic current... But the common denominator is a desire to bring so-called 'developed' societies back into balance with the living world, in a way that reduces inequality and improves human well-being.</p><p>For a more detailed definition, we couldn't do better than the amazing <a href="https://degrowth.info/degrowth" target="_blank">degrowth.info website</a>. Feel free to check their many resources, and if the idea speaks to you, welcome in the community!</p>
