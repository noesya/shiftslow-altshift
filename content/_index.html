      What is Degrowth?
    position: 4
    data:
      text: >-
        <p><span>There are many ways to define it: as an activist slogan, a social and political movement, an umbrella concept, an academic current... </span></p><p>All in all, it's a call for radical social, political and economic transformation in order to bring so-called 'developed' societies back into balance with the living world, in a way that reduces inequality and improves human well-being.</p><p>Degrowth is a pluralistic, subversive and open-ended utopia: a call for a new, qualitatively different world that will emerge from and through confronting the existing one.</p><p>Degrowth is not alone. It is just one among many alternatives to development. All these worldviews and practices compose the Pluriverse: "A world where many worlds fit", as the Zapatistas say.</p><p>For a more detailed definition,<a href="https://degrowth.info/degrowth" target="_blank"> check out the amazing degrowth.info website</a>. Feel free to delve into their many resources, and if the idea speaks to you, welcome in the community!</p>
