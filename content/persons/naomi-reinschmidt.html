<p>I am a climate justice and food sovereignty activist, currently co-coordinating an austrian film festival about the right to food. I have been very lucky and got to live and study in Latin America for a little more than two years. There, through my experiences with places and people, their stories, and through my studies, I got the opportunity to become acquainted with and explore cosmovisions, worldviews, and thus approaches to life other than the one(s) I grew up with. As a social and cultural anthropologist, I temporarily laid a focus on the human-environment relationship, particularly looking at socio-ecological conflicts and underlying power relations. Due to an internal shift, I started to focus more on life affirming practices and philosophies rather than the deconstruction of dominant destructive patterns. This brought me to agroecology and a general focus on regenerative designs - my motivation-giving passion. I pursue to co-create and nurture narratives of "interbeing", so that a good life for all beings becomes possible.</p>
