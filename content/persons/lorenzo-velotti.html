<p>I am currently a PhD candidate at the Faculty of Political and Social Sciences at the Scuola Normale Superiore and a member of Research and Degrowth (R&amp;D) and the Centre on Social Movement Studies (COSMOS). My research is on commons' movements and care, with an ethnographic approach, in Barcelona and Naples.I am holding a Msc in Anthropology and Development from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a bachelor's in Political, Social and International Sciences from the University of Bologna.</p><p>Since my masters', during which I researched degrowth social currencies in Catalunya, I came to see degrowth as a very powerful tool to envision a way out of present interrelated crises, as well as to connect different struggles for such socioecological transformation. In terms of research, I am particularly interested in degrowth from the point of view of economic anthropology, and am currently focusing on UBI.</p>
