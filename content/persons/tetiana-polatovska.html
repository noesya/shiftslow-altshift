<p>I am Tati, I grew up in a small village of Northern Kyiv, currently living in Manchester, UK. I did an MA in Political Ecology, Degrowth and Environmental Justice in Barcelona and an MSc in Environmental Assessment and Management in Salford. My passion is to organize various educational events. Since 2019 I have organized Ecology Weeks for Ukrainian kids and two editions of DegrowthÂ  Summer School in Barcelona. I love to engage in the topics of food sovereignty, socio-ecological justice and alternative ways of living.</p><p><br></p>
