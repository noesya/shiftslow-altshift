<p>I am a professional actor interested in the relationship between art and ecology. My formation includes different high formation courses in musical theatre, theatre of the senses and theatre for children. I hold a BSc in Business and Economics from the University of Bologna and am currently getting my Masters in Political Ecology and Degrowth at the Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona. My thesis is a theatre performance about environmental justice struggles related to waste disposal. I founded a theatre school for children in my home town, for which I work as a coordinator and educator. Now I am focusing on how to connect art to a just socio-ecological transition through workshops, performances and writings.</p>
