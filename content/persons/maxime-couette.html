<p>I am a student in political ecology, degrowth and environmental justice from Lyon, France. Currently living in Paris, I am writing a masters thesis on well-being within planetary boundaries, while working as an educator on climate change issues at the Climate Fresk association. After co-organising a summer school on degrowth in 2021, I jumped into the Alt Shift Festival adventure in order to experiment a new way of connecting like-minded people and activists, while creating a space for radical education and experimentation.</p>
