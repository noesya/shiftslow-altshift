<p>Floating between Amsterdam and Rotterdam I did a dual bachelors in Arts and Cultural studies, and in Autonomous fine arts, with a minor in sustainability and Economics. Both my art research practice and academic interests have revolved around gentrification processes, urban commons and art activism. Currently working on a small opera that aims to give voice to women's anger in the wake of social injustices, and illustrating a frog and toad-themed tarot deck.</p>
