        <p><strong>Unveiling ShiftSlow's vision beyond<br>the AltShift festival</strong><br><br>As we've delved into the AltShift festival's structure, content, and<br>discussions in previous posts, now is the moment to unravel the story behind<br>ShiftSlow, the association behind the festival. Join me in exploring our<br>dreams, challenges, and aspirations that extend far beyond the festival<br>grounds, as we navigate the tapestry woven by ShiftSlow's vision.</p><p><b>From bureaucratic roots to a dreamy<br>top<br><br></b>My journey with ShiftSlow<br>started as a bureaucratic necessity—a vessel to manifest the festival. But what<br>unfolded surpassed mere paperwork; AltShift was the seed, ShiftSlow the<br>possibility for it to bloom. This whole process pushed us towards creating an<br>association, while hinting at something far more ambitious. As we navigated the<br>formation of ShiftSlow, questions about our collective journey emerged. And we<br>are still exploring the concrete direction of the journey. </p><p><strong>Navigating legal waters <br><br></strong>In the process of penning<br>down our association's statutes, we found ourselves at a crossroads of<br>possibilities. Every clause, every word seemed to hold the potential for<br>expansive action. It wasn't merely a legal exercise; it became a moment of<br>exploration. Which topics do we want to bring to the foreground? Which formats<br>besides the festival might be interesting? Would we be able to coordinate these<br>ideas, or would we need partners for that?<br><br>While defining the scope of ShiftSlow's activities, I realized that this wasn't<br>just about framing regulations; it was about identifying our potential avenues<br>for transformative impact. </p><p><strong>The practical challenges <br><br></strong>However, dreams are often<br>constrained by financial realities. As we contemplate expanding our vision,<br>practical questions about sustainability and funding become prominent.<br>"How do we finance this?" reverberates as a constant theme in our regular<br>discussions, extending the dream beyond organizing educational and celebratory<br>events to even imagining workspaces for our team. However, the dream of a<br>shared physical space, where the team could meet face-to-face, proves elusive<br>and somewhat nostalgic in the context of our geographical dispersion. The vast<br>expanse of physical separation among our team members, scattered throughout<br>Europe, creates a concrete challenge. The yearning for a tangible, shared<br>workspace transcends online limitations, reflecting a truth: certain<br>conversations find their most effective expression in shared physical spaces. </p><p><strong>Weaving dreams into reality</strong>  <br><br>As I reflect on the profound connection between AltShift festival and<br>ShiftSlow, a colourful weaving of experimental pedagogical formats emerges.<br>AltShift stands as a flagship initiative, where we successfully manifested a<br>dream into reality and crafted a physical space—a temporary utopian world for a<br>few enchanting days. Yet, this feels just as the beginning of something that is<br>yet to uncover. ShiftSlow envisions extending this utopian spirit into the<br>fabric of everyday life, nurturing solidarity, communal living, accountability<br>processes, and collective care. This journey is a curious one, full of possibilities.</p><p><strong>Looking Ahead…</strong><br><br>With ShiftSlow embodying a commitment to a colorful and just transition, our<br>collective investigation moves us into the future. How can we carve celebratory<br>spaces for conviviality and co-creation, maybe even transcending the boundaries<br>of the degrowth movement and reaching into broader horizons? The path forward<br>for ShiftSlow is one of envisioning these broader horizons and venturing into<br>experimental pedagogical realms. Come along on this journey with us, share your<br>thoughts, and let's collaboratively shape the future of ShiftSlow. Your input<br>is highly valued, and together, we'll persist in crafting the story of an<br>equitable, vibrant, and eco-social transition. Stay connected, stay motivated,<br>and let's transform these visions into tangible reality.</p><p>In solidarity, </p><p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p><p>Naomi</p>
