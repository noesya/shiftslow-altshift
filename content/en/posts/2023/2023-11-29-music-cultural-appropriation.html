        <p>Music is a medium that has allowed me to express my resistance, solidarity, and<br>political alliances with local and inthernational movements in the age of globalizing<br>forces.</p><p>Through the album Sweet as Broken Dates: Lost Somali Tapes from the Horn of Africa, I<br>learned about the Somali civil war and its cultural repression that forced artists to hide<br>their tapes in a bunker in order to protect their musical heritage. Through Radio<br>Alhara, I’ve explored Palestinian solidarity through oral mediums and soundscapes.<br>And in the Vulture Prince album, I experienced the poetics of pain, grief, and friendship<br>through Arooj Aftab’s Urdu mother tongue.</p><p>Music is a crucial part in the path towards liberation, with its rhythms, melodies, and<br>cadences. It asks for individual and collective movement, for experimentation and play,<br>and for fluidity. Bearing witness and grooving to music from different corners of the<br>world is also a way to challenge the epistemic and musical dominance of Western<br>imperial forces. It’s a part of resisting the monoculture tendencies of knowledge<br>production in the Global North, as Robin Wall Kimmerer beautifully argues in her<br>writings.</p><p>But becoming a witness and a listener comes with the responsibility of acknowledging<br>longstanding traditions and understanding their historical and cultural relevance in<br>relation to Global South communities. This was a topic of discussion during the last<br>edition of the festival, where conversations about cultural appropriation were alive<br>within those days. In hindsight, these discussions stemmed from important questions:<br>considering the academic and white-majority audiences within the degrowth<br>movement, of which the festival is inevitably a mirror, how dto we avoid uncritically<br>consuming music from the Global South? In what ways can the festival embody a<br>deep-rooted and informed praxis of allyship by going beyond the performative? How<br>do we recentre music as a political element, while also allowing it to be fun, playful<br>and not always oh so serious? bell hooks, and the black feminist tradition at large,<br>has brought nuanced reflections to this topic when she argued that “cultural, ethnic,<br>and racial differences” are “continually commodified and offered up as new dishes to<br>enhance the white palate”, meaning that “the Other will be eaten, consumed, and<br>forgotten”.</p><p><br><br><br><br><br></p><p>I wish I could tell you that we came up with a straightforward answer to this, but we<br>did not. However, it became clear for us that the gift of music comes with<br>responsibilities: of bringing information, cultivating awareness, according due credit,<br>striving for nuance, and embodying a praxis of allyship. Music asks us to reify our<br>political commitments and to take them from the theoretical to the practical. And<br>ultimately, it call us to question our desires and to reflect on how they may inform our<br>politics and our understanding of difference.</p>
