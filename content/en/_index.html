        <p>If it's a shift we are desiring in our society, a shift away from eco-social injustices, from consumerism, from the colonial matrix of power; a shift in a direction we are shining lights on, even if we need more lights to pave the way. Then this shift must be preceded by pressing Alt.</p><p>Alt+Shift is a combination of keys that allows us to open up a window of possibilities from the few keys that we are given in our keyboard. It is opening another world that yet it's difficult to envision with solely the tools we've been given. We need new tools and a new narrative, that must be altogether altering, alternative and altruistic.</p><p>Alt-ogether, because to change something, we must start everywhere.</p><p>Alt-ering, because everything must change. </p><p>Alt-ernative because green growth, "development" and ecomodernism are not path forwards but narratives that are advancing a capitalist and colonial agenda.</p><p>Alt-ruistic, because caring must be at the centre, and no one must be left behind. Let's explore together where alt-shift will bring us.</p>
