        <p><b>Maybe you have been wondering about the ticket price of the Altshift? </b></p><p>  We want to be transparent with you about where your ticket price is going, therefore a little break-up here: a quarter of our money goes to us, the organisers to be able to come to the place for free while working for making the festival happen, another quarter goes to the accommodation inKunst in der Natur, which is hosting us in their place for the week, providing camping ground, water electricity, their kitchen and use of all spaces, yet another quarter is going to the workshops, concerts, performers and materials while the last quarter pays mostly for the three delicious vegan meals we offer you per day, more specifically, mostly to the community-supported agriculture next door from Kunst in der Natur, where Tristan is already starting to grow vegg for the festival these days. </p><p>  </p>
