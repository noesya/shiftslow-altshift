        <p>We want this festival to be an accessible and safe space for all those who wish to join us in building alliances for a radical degrowth movement. We need you - all of you, with your quirks, crazy haircuts, different abilities and dog-eared niche paperbacks.</p><p>We offer reduced ticket prices to accommodate accessibility needs through a sliding scale. This tool allows people to access the AltShift at varying prices, acknowledging that financial resources, including income, should not dictate access to services or care.</p><p>For the sliding scale to work, it relies on honesty, responsibility and accountability. We won’t ask you for proof of income - we trust you to be truthful and aware of your needs. Regardless, we want to remind you that there’s a limited amount of reduced tickets, and choosing to take them if you can afford the full price will stop other people from accessing the festival.</p><p>  </p><p>For visualizing purposes and to get you to reflect on your purchasing power, we are using the<b> green bottle system</b>.</p>
