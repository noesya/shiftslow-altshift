      How to spread degrowth? (Humus)
    position: 3
    data:
      layout: no_background
      text: >-
        <p>The degrowth movement seeks to transform our society by shifting priorities from overproduction, -consumption and corporate profit to ecological and social well-being, solidarity, and social justice. As such it is up against strong, hegemonial narratives and forces, which make spreading degrowth ideas and values difficult. In these sessions we will look at different aspects of „spreading“: campaigning and narratives on one day; mobilisation and movement buidling on the other side.  Each topic will be introduced with input and exercises, followed by some time to try out, experiment and be creative. If the sessions feel to short for your sparking ideas, you can alsways use the open spaces in the afternoon to continue dreaming and/or planning.</p><p>(Happening: Monday &amp; Tuesday 9.30-12)<br><br></p>

      Artivism! (Germinar-t &amp; the Lab)
    position: 4

      layout: no_background
      text: >-
        <p>Come with us into a journey into exploring the liminal edge between art and activism. When is art political? How can we explore political topics in an artistic way? How can we start to research that in groups and collectives? We are going to go deeper into these questions, hearing from people’s experiences and trying to plant some seeds of  artistic creation in the meanwhile!</p><p><i>(Thursday &amp; Friday 9.30-12)</i></p>
