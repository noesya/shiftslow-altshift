        <p>Alt shift is a collective that condemns all forms of oppression, including racism, sexism, homophobia, misogyny, ableism, capitalism, colonialism, antisemitism, and any other form of discrimination. We denounce the violence resulting from contemporary settler colonial dynamics and ethnic cleansing, as seen in Israel and Palestine, Sudan, Tigray, and other regions.</p><p>We acknowledge that in our challenge of oppressive systems we stand on the shoulders of many preceding struggles for liberation and do not fight in isolation. We are all interconnected and interdependent. We advocate for radical social change and justice, aligning ourselves with decolonial, anti-racist, anti-fascist, anti-ableist, anti-speciesist, anti-capitalist, anti-imperialist, anti-colonial, anti-war, trans-feminist, queer, and ecological movements and show up in solidarity.</p><p>We recognize that in this struggle tensions can arise within our team and the festival space we hope to create. We encourage self-organized engagement when there is rejection of planned content, structures, or dynamics at Alt Shift. Our aim is to create a safer space, welcoming constructive criticism and fostering dialogue. We aim to create diverse and inclusive communities, knowing this requires openness, a willingness to listen to different worldviews, philosophies and ways of being.</p><p>Furthermore, we acknowledge that many on our organizing team possess intersecting privileges, such as whiteness, middle-class status, abled-bodies and European backgrounds. We strive to actively reflect on these privileges and make an effort to deconstruct toxic behaviors that may arise from them.</p><p>Alt shift strives for eco-social transformation, addressing the root causes of environmental and social problems, including the unequal distribution of power and resources, the exploitation of nature and people, and the dominant values that justify them. We reject capitalism as a system that inherently leads to imperialism and racism. Alt shift promotes de-alienation, aiming to recover our sense of identity, agency and belonging in an oppressive, exploitative, and marginalizing society. We reconnect with our history, culture, spirituality, and community.</p><p>We support degrowth as a political and economic theory that promotes shrinking economies, prioritizing the well-being of all life over profit. Economic growth is no longer seen as necessary for improving human living standards and is recognized as causing widespread socio-ecological damage.</p><p>Our approach is intersectional, recognizing the interrelatedness and interdependence of all life and thus all resistance to forms of oppression. We are all pluriversal and thus we value diverse forms of knowledge and interdisciplinary approaches, seeking to create a more just, resilient, and sustainable world.</p>
