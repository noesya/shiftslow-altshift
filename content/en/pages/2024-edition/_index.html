        <p>Next to our good old degrowthers, we explicitly welcome friends and allies from other eco socialist and social justice movements such as the climate justice movement, feminist abolitionism, queer and trans movements, migrant solidarity and black and indigenous rights movements. We want to create a space to learn from each other and support our connected struggles. Join us in this endeavour!<br></p>
