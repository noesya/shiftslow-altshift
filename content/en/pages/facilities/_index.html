        <p>The most convenient and lowest-impact way to travel<br></p><p>is by train. You can take a night train from many</p><p>major European cities to Vienna and from there the</p><p>connection to the festival place is quite easy. Your</p><p>destination is “Buchberg/Kamp”. From there, it is a 15-20 minutes walk up to the place. </p>
