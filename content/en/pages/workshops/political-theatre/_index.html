        <p><span>In this workshop we will explore together and with our bodies what collective resilience means to us. Against neoliberal tendencies that marketize selfcare, individualize and lead to even more pressure on individuals, we want to approach the topic of resilience systemically and critically.</span><br></p><p>How can groups and collectives be sustainably active? Which structures and group cultures hinder us and which do us good? To what extent do political groups reproduce discrimination and oppression; and how can we intervene against it? And what does all this have to do with degrowth?</p><p><span>We will explore these questions on a theatrical research journey using methods from Theatre of the Oppressed. No prior experience is needed - bring comfortable clothes and shoes and let's go! "Let's be careful with each other, so we can be dangerous together".</span></p>
