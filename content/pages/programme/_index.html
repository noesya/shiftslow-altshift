            A trip through four thematic streams: Radical Nature Connection; (Un)Building DeGrowth; Embodied Decoloniality
            Prosocial Commons.In the mornings, we prepared you four amazing workshops corresponding to each of the thematic streams. Splitted in four groups, you will get to experience each of them throughout the week.
            
            The afternoons will be dedicated to semi-spontaneous co-creation: do you want to organise a workshop? A performance? A sharing circle? A debating space? What do you want to bring to the festival? The floor is yours!
            
            If you have an idea, get in touch with us and we'll provide you with the space and tools to realise it.
