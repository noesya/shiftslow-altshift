A performance? A sharing circle? A debating space? What do you want to bring to the festival? The floor is yours!</span></p><p><span>If you have an idea, <a href="http://altshift.festival@gmail.com/" target="_blank">get in touch with us</a> and we'll provide you with the space and tools to realise it. </span></p>
