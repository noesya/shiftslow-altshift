<p>You are the programme</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>We don't invite you to be participant at yet another cultural event, be co-creator of the festival. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Join the earth team to keep our place clean and beautiful.</p><p>Join our water team to keep the sacred resource in its cycle and ourselves hydrated.</p><p>Join our kitchen team to provide us with wholesome vegan food.</p><p>Join the programme by sharing your art, skills or knowledge through a workshop, performance, concert or open space. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>You are invited to co-create the space, collectively caring for and about it for the time of the festival. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>We see this co-creation as act of political prefiguration: building a temporary autonomous zone in which we envision and enact desirable futures. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>We are going to be around 150 people sharing the space for a week. On Friday all of us come from our distinct bubbles and realities with our various physical and emotional baggage and maybe absurd paces of life. On Saturday we go through a landing process, to meet the land and the people through sharing and deconstructing. On Sunday,  the week-long immersion into envisioning and enacting degrowth realities begins. We create 4 groups of around 30 people which are going through that journey together. We  prepared four workshops for between breakfast and lunch, which every group goes through in a different order. Our four thematic streams are radical nature connection, degrowth building and architecture, decolonial embodiment and the prosocial commons. The afternoons are open spaces meaning we count on all of you to generate emotional, embodied or mental knowledge, propose workshops and sessions in which we can inspire each other, get inspired, collaborate and step forward to action. On Friday, after closing reflection circles, we invite local artesanals for a market space and close our week with celebration. Expect groove and jungle vibes before packing up on Saturday and leaving fulfilled with connection, new tools for critical deconstruction, seeds of inspiration and zest for action.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>With our four streams we are not trying to represent the degrowth movement, neither contemporary tendencies within the degrowth movement. They were coming organically out of our own interests, connections and processes.</p><p>Radical Nature Connection</p><p>UnBuilding DeGrowth</p><p>Embodied Decoloniality</p><p>Prosocial Commons</p><p>(more info coming soon)</p><p><span>Proposing these from our side, we open up the organizational side for semi-spontaneous co-creation: what do you want to bring to the degrowth festival?</span><br></p>
