        <p><span>We move at the intersection of degrowth and art</span></p><p><span>We want the <a href="https://degrowth.info/degrowth" target="_blank">degrowth movement</a> </span><span>to be more colourful, creative, artistic, playful, experimental, embodied ... through arts!</span></p><p>The arts can mobilise for socio-ecological change, as they transmit more than we can rationally grasp: our emotions, our rage, our fears, our hopes, and what we fight for. <span>Let</span><span> our artistic practices be the life-juice of the degrowth movement!</span></p><p>In the art residency, we focus on co-creating degrowth-based art practices. We want to invent, embody and inhabit them together. Meanwhile - we stand in solidarity with all the ones involved in actively fighting against fossil fuelled, colonial, patriarchal growth addicted structures and practices of art institutions. </p><p>The art residency allows us to join this fight in creating a community around collaborative artistic processes for further action, exchanging and creating tools for art based degrowth practices.</p>

      The Programme

        <p>The programme of the residency is divided in different spheres. During the first two days, we add ingredients to our pots, and you are offered inputs in the form of different workshops and activities. We will get to know each other more in depth through body, mind and soul; we will be given an educational tour of the eco-community and we will provide our hands and brains for some work, shaping the gardens or fermenting some awesome food in the kitchen. We will delve into the history of environmental justice conflict of the region and its related social struggles. Round tables and outdoor spaces will be set up for discussing views on art and degrowth, and we will share our works and inspiration around those two concepts. </p><p>After the ingredients are added, it's time to turn on the fire! During the second part, we will melt into groups to start our artistic investigation. Almost four days will be devoted to experiment with our art practices, with our feelings, with the surroundings, with the community, with the village and with group dynamics. The process we will go through will be presented on the last day to the inhabitants of the local community,as a frame of the evolution of our research. </p><p>Other spaces will be constant through the week, as our daily rituals. In the morning we are going to enjoy a sharing circle, and in the evenings, before dinner, we are going to have time to learn from each other our artistic practices. </p><p>After dinner we spice it up: the space will usually be open, but stay tuned for some video-art sharing and the traditional Existential Wednesday of the community!</p>

      Story

        <p>The facilitators, Carlo, Lara and Laura met two years ago, in the degrowth master in Barcelona. Carlo as actor, Lara and Laura as artivism-researchers, all diving deep into degrowth, got excited about entering into a collaborative, investigative, artistic and degrowth based process. They started to create informal spaces for movement, exploration, play, experimentation, co-creation, intimate creativity, drawing, conviviality, other trans-feminist brujerias throughout the year and ...</p><p>... here we go: we are thrilled to invite you to join Germinar-t., a community based degrowth art residency in which we explore the space at the intersection between art and degrowth for one week.</p>

        <p>Throughout the week we are hosted by the community <a href="https://www.sunseed.org.uk" target="_blank">Sunseed Desert Technology</a> in an off-grid village in the semi-arid environment of South East Spain.</p><p> It is a potent place to create a degrowth art residency, as our community is dealing with the direct effects of the agroindustry, super intensive olive plantations and megaprojects of solar panel farms. W<span>ater scarcity and soil depletion are destroying ecosystems and people's livelihoods. </span><span>The Sunseed community aims at regenerative practices in harmony with all beings. </span></p><p><span>Gain a little audio impression of Sunseed through our </span><a href="https://soundcloud.com/communication-827980279/seeds-of-change-episode-1" target="_blank">community based podcast</a><span>.</span></p>

      Contextual Creation

        <p><span>We believe in the power of art to help create community and momentum. We encourage art in dialogue with its ecological, social, political and cultural environments. Concretely, we mean the Sunseed community, the neighbours,  the overexploited aquifers and depleted soils, the stubborn shrubs and bushes as well as the turtles and eagles inhabiting the area.</span></p><p>We invite you to help visibilize the community's work and the environmental justice struggle, to discover and transform the roles of artistic creation in eco-communities, to leave something with the community: artistic (educational?) ideas, impressions, tools that can serve even future generations of the Sunseed community.<br></p>

      Participation Fee

        <p>We are actively trying to make the residency as accessible as possible. As is any project there are costs involved in meeting all of our basic needs, we have tried to minimise these as much as possible, as we realise that travellin  to the community is already a big expense and having the time to work in artistic projects is sometimes a privilege. We are looking for funding, and if we will receive it, it will go into reducing the present fee. </p><p>For now, the fee is 180 euro for each participant. It is covering, for the whole week:</p><ul> <li><p>Contribution to accommodation, which will help the community with their expenses and will keep the project running.</p></li> <li><p>Delicious vegan food, with most veggies and fruits coming from Sunseed's gardens</p></li> <li><p>Material for the artistic process.</p></li> <li><p>We, as facilitators, are privileged enough to be able to volunteer for this project. Your contribution to our work is the food and accommodation in the community and the cost of the trip to reach the place.</p></li> </ul>
