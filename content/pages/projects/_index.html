      Idea
    position: 2
    data:
      text: >-
        <p>We aim to create space at the intersection of degrowth and art. </p><p>The degrowth movement has good ideas for global social ecological transformation that are written black on white in many laptop screens in fancy European cities (yes that is a bit reductive but you get the image). We could become more ... colourful, creative, artistic, playful, experimental, embodied ... through art!</p><p>Wait, wait... degrowth, what? Again:</p><p>Degrowth gives us a hard truth, economic growth cannot continue being our only and common pursuit, this is because it needs infinite resource extraction and social injustices in order to continue. Until now we have found degrowth to be too much in the academic sphere and we want to move it into our communities by holding creative spaces of artistic co-creation.</p><p>The arts are powerful in kicking us out of our mental and practical routines. They take us on journeys alternating between intimate immersion and critical meta-levels. They tickle our imagination and help us co-create alternative, desirable futures. They can mobilise for socio-ecological change, as they transmit more than we can rationally grasp, they transmit our emotions, our rage, our fears, our hopes, and what we fight for. </p><p>Let our artistic practices be the life-juice of the degrowth movement! We want to create regenerative communities around artistic practices, and inspire our fellow beings to join us. Degrowth based art is a set of practices we want to cultivate around the values of community, conviviality, interdependence, deep democracy, global justice, decolonial feminisms and political ecology. </p><p>In the art residency, we focus on co-creating alternative art practices. We want to invent, embody and inhabit them. Meanwhile, we don't forget about the crucial fight against and within the institutional art world - we stand in solidarity with all the ones involved in actively fighting against fossil fuelled, colonial, patriarchal growth addicted art institutions and practices. The art residency allows us to join this fight in creating a community around collaborative artistic processes for further action, exchanging and creating tools for art based degrowth practices. Our aim is to nourish this community and have as outcome transformative practices.</p>

      The Programme
    position: 3

        <p>The program of the residency is divided in different spheres. During the first two days, we add ingredients to our pots, and you are offered inputs in the form of different workshops and activities. We will get to know each other more in depth through body, mind and soul; we will be given an educational tour of the eco-community and we will provide our hands and brains for some work, shaping the gardens or fermenting some awesome food in the kitchen. We will delve into the history of environmental justice conflict of the region and its related social struggles. Round tables and outdoor spaces will be set up for discussing views on art and degrowth, and we will share our works and inspiration around those two concepts. </p><p>After the ingredients are added, it's time to turn on the fire! During the second part, we will melt into groups to start our artistic investigation. Almost four days will be devoted to experiment with our art practices, with our feelings, with the surroundings, with the community, with the village and with group dynamics. The process we will go through will be presented on the last day to the inhabitants of the local community,as a frame of the evolution of our research. </p><p>Other spaces will be constant through the week, as our daily rituals. In the morning we are going to enjoy a sharing circle, and in the evenings, before dinner, we are going to have time to learn from each other our artistic practices. </p><p>After dinner we spice it up: the space will usually be open, but stay tuned for some video-art sharing and the traditional Existential Wednesday of the community!</p>

        <p>The facilitators, Carlo, Lara and Laura met two years ago, in the degrowth master in Barcelona. Carlo as actor, Lara and Laura as artivism-researchers, all diving deep into degrowth, got excited about entering into a collaborative, investigative, artistic and degrowth based process. They started to create informal spaces for movement, exploration, play, experimentation, co-creation, intimate creativity, drawing, conviviality, other trans-feminist brujerias throughout the year and ...</p><p>... here we go: we are thrilled to invite you to join Germinar-t., a community based degrowth art residency in which we explore the space at the intersection between art and degrowth for one week. </p><p>Inhabit this space</p><p>Make it a place</p><p>Make it a playground</p><p>Make it a home</p><p>Create community. </p><p>Sit in the fire and around the fire.</p>

      Place

        <p>Throughout the week we are hosted by the community Sunseed Desert Technology in the semi-desert of Southeast Spain. It is a potent place to create a degrowth art residency, as our community is dealing with the direct effects of the agroindustry, super intensive olive plantations and megaprojects of solar panel farms. The effects are of social and ecological nature: water scarcity and soil depletion is destroying precious ecosystems and people's livelihoods. Sunseed is a counterexample of a community aiming at regenerative practices in harmony with all beings. What can Sunseed be beyond that? Can we grant personhood to our groundwater basin and thereby help defend the livelihoods of people in the region and ecosystems from the agroindustry? Can we stop the extractive practices before the river dries out? Can we mobilise people locally and globally to join us in the fight? We believe in the power of art to help create community and momentum. While you are free in choosing your artistic direction, we encourage art in dialogue with its ecological, social, political and cultural environments. Concretely, we mean the Sunseed community, the neighbours and our houses,  the overexploited aquifers and depleted soils, the stubborn shrubs and bushes as well as the turtles and eagles inhabiting the area.</p><p><span>As a gesture of respect towards Sunseeders that are sharing the space, meals and consciousness with us for the week, we would like to invite you to make yourself knowledgeable about the community before joining. How?</span><br></p><p>Check out the attached Sunseed volunteer kit for context, background info and all practical information that is useful to know before arriving. </p><p>Listen in to the podcast that has been created in Sunseed over the past months to introduce the community, our environmental justice struggle and a broader vision on ecovillages as part of socio-ecological transformation. </p><p>Scroll through the Sunseed website containing a lot of information about what else is going on within the community and the environmental education centre. </p><p><b></b><br><br></p>

      Participation Fee

      text: >-
        <p>We are actively trying to make the residency as accessible as possible. As is any project there are costs involved in meeting all of our basic needs, we have tried to minimise these as much as possible, as we realise that travellin  to the community is already a big expense and having the time to work in artistic projects is sometimes a privilege. We are looking for funding, and if we will receive it, it will go into reducing the present fee. </p><p>For now, the fee is 180 euro for each participant. It is covering, for the whole week:</p><ul> <li><p>Contribution to accommodation, which will help the community with their expenses and will keep the project running.</p></li> <li><p>Delicious vegan food, with most veggies and fruits coming from Sunseed's gardens</p></li> <li><p>Material for the artistic process.</p></li> <li><p>We, as facilitators, are privileged enough to be able to volunteer for this project. Your contribution to our work is the food and accommodation in the community and the cost of the trip to reach the place.</p></li> </ul>
