        <p>Commons are everywhere. When people share a resource they will often over-harvest it because they see it in their individual interest to take as much from the resource as possible before others deplete it. In the same way, people don't want to contribute if others freeload, preventing a lot of cooperative ventures from succeeding. Since the 1950s, economists have argued that the protection and expansion of commons can only be prevented via privatisation or governmental regulation. The term ‘tragedy’ is used to argue that people are unable to self-govern common resources. In recent decades, an increasing awareness has emerged that tragedy is not the only possible outcome, in fact self-governance can often preserve common resources better than either privatisation or regulation. A set of recommendations for commons management have emerged, and we examine these principles and look to their practical implementation in our own organizations.<br></p>
