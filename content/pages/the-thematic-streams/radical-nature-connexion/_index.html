        <p>How can we be and work with nature rather than against it to support the creation of life?</p><p>What visions of a close relationship with the natural sphere is needed to foster a shift in our social and economic relationships?</p><p> In this workshop we will awaken our senses through mindfulness and imagination practices, movement and play in nature. Feeling connected to nature and its manifold interrelated elements has many benefits such as elevated motivation, more mental clarity, greater resilience – overall, supporting a greater general well-being.</p><p>Nature connection can be understood as the way we relate to and experience nature. It is recognized that it has great potential for personal and collective transformation. Nature connection can inspire to create socioecological change, to bring regenerative and collaborative practices to life and, if practiced radically, to challenge oppressive systems.</p><p><span>There is a long cascading history explaining not only why many feel disconnected from nature, but also why we degrade the natural environment to an irreversible state, taking away our own base for life. We need to build new relationships while also moderating the damaging relationships at key leverage points.</span></p><p><span>This workshop draws on wisdom of non-dominant cultural cosmologies and alternative ways that recognize the systemic interrelationships between cultural and ecological dimensions – seeing humans as part of nature, not separated from it. A sustainable, more just, and flourishing future requires going further than emission reducing pro-environmental behavior.</span></p><p><span>Together we will go on a sensory and embodied learning journey that is about finding beauty, emotion and meaning in nature while placing nature connection in a political framework.</span></p>
