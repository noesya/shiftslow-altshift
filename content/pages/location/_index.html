      Art in Nature

        <p>The location of the festival is the magical "<a href="https://www.kunstindernatur.at/about-1/" target="_blank">Art in Nature</a>", a place on the Wachtberg in the forest district of Lower Austria.</p><p>Art in Nature was born in 1993 from the idea of providing a place for people from different backgrounds to exchange artistic ideas and to co-create. Art, music and performance are created in the enjoyment of nature, being surrounded by forest. Community supported agriculture, bodywork, awareness retreats, children's camps, sustainability workshops, readings or documentary films are only a part of the uses of the Wachtberg.</p><p>Due to its unique location, in the middle of nature, the Wachtberg became a hub for culture over time and leaves visitors very inspired.</p><p>We are incredibly grateful to be hosted by this piece of land and the people living on it and to be able to make it an even more beautiful and vibrant place.</p>

      How to get there?

        <p><b>Train from the East // Vienna</b></p><p>The quickest and most convenient way to get to the festival is by taking a train from <b>Wien Franz-Josephs Bahnhof</b> to <b>Hadersdorf/Kamp Bahnhof</b> (9 stops // direction “Krems/Donau Bahnhof”).</p><p>Due to construction work, the second part of the journey is by bus, as a replacement for the train, from <b>Hadersdorf/Kamp</b> to <b>Buchberg/Kamp</b>. <a href="https://kundeninformation-pv.oebb.at/dam/kundeninformation/extern/OEBB/2022/2022_08/Serv10140_Gesamt.pdf" target="_blank">This</a> is the schedule.</p><p>The festival site is then a 20 minutes walk from the train station. Once you get out of the train station, you will find signs that lead you all the way to “Kunst in der Natur”.</p><p>The travel takes about 1:30h – max. 2h to the final destination. The trains to Hadersdorf/Kamp Bahnhof leave Wien Franz-Josephs Bahnhof every hour and every 30 minutes in the afternoon.</p><p>Tickets are around 21 EUR to Buchberg/Kamp. The rail replacement bus is included in that price. You can buy the ticket from wherever you come from either at a ticket machine or here (currently not working as the construction work is not yet included in the system - but it should work later in august!) and type in “Buchberg/Kamp” as your final destination. Please note that it is not possible to transport bicycles on the buses of the rail replacement service. </p><p>Busses leave Hadersdorf/Kamp outside the train station between 7:11 AM and 11:11 PM hourly plus at 2:36 PM, 3:34 PM, 4:33 PM, 5:33 PM, 6:33 PM, 7:33 PM, 8:33PM. The bus will say “Schienenersatzverkehr” (“train replacement”) and maybe direction “Horn”. But please ask the bus driver in case of uncertainty! Also you can call 0043/5-1717.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Night trains and busses to Vienna</b><br></p><p>There is a direct connection by night train or bus to Vienna from many major European Cities (like Paris, Brussels, Stockholm, Amsterdam, Berlin, Zurich, Warsaw, Rome, Frankfurt and many others). Check either the homepage of <a href="https://www.nightjet.com/en/" target="_blank">Nightjet</a> (by the Austrian Railways), <a href="https://www.raileurope.com/" target="_blank">Raileurope</a>, <a href="https://www.thetrainline.com/trains/europe/night-trains" target="_blank">Trainline</a> or <a href="https://www.flixbus.de/" target="_blank">Flixbus</a>. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>By car</b></p><p>There are parking spaces at the festival site. We also have spaces for camper vans. If you type “Kunst in der Natur” or the whole address “Am Wachtberg, 3571 Gars am Kamp, Waldviertel, Lower Austria” into your navigation system, you will find your way there. We will put signs at tricky crossings and lead you to the location.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p><b>Lift share</b></p><p>Those coming by car are encouraged to let us know of any spare seats so they can pick up people on the way. Please email us at <a href="altshift.festival@gmail.com" target="_blank">altshift.festival@gmail.com</a> so that we can link you up.<br></p>
