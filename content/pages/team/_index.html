  We are a bunch of humans who came together during the degrowth summer school 2021 in Barcelona. We were organizers, participants or volunteers, dreamers and aspiring change makers.

  <h2>Story</h2><p><span>The degrowth summer school was amazing. It made us come together. We pushed a lot of content into our brains, and participated in some dozens of workshops by inspiring activist-academics and artists. </span><br></p><p>Asking ourselves: what would come up if we left space, time, energy for sharing inspirations, skills and knowledge amongst us? For really getting to know each other? </p><p>We are on a collective investigation. </p><p>How to create a celebratory space for conviviality and co-creation for the movement?</p><h2>Alt-Shift Association</h2><p>Alt-Shift is an association born from the degrowth movement. To be able to mount the project of the festival, we created the association: Alt-Shift. With this association we aim to create radical, embodied, holistic spaces: events, festivals,and also just content: all around the topic of degrowth. The festival idea is the first seed of the project, lets plant a forest. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Alt-Shift stands for alt-together, alt-ering, alternative and alt-rustic and is a space for holistic embodied and political knowledge generation. </p><p>A space that we can reclaim for the collective celebration of life. </p><p>A space where we can build an autonomous and caring community.</p>
