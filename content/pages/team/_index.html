        We became a team while organising last year's degrowth summer school in Barcelona. <span>It was nice pushing a lot of content into our brains, and participating in many workshops presented by inspiring activist-academics and artists.</span><div><br></div><div>But then we asked ourselves: what would happen if we left more space, time and energy for sharing inspirations, skills and knowledge amongst us? <span>For really getting to know each other?</span> </div><div><span><br></span></div><div><span>We are on a collective investigation: how to create a celebratory space for conviviality and co-creation for the degrowth movement and beyond?  </span></div>
