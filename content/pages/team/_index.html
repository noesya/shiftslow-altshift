<h2>Story</h2><p><span>The degrowth summer school was amazing. It made us come together. We pushed a lot of content into our brains, and participated in some dozens of workshops by inspiring activist-academics and artists. </span><br></p><p>Asking ourselves: what would come up if we left space, time, energy for sharing inspirations, skills and knowledge amongst us? For really getting to know each other? </p><p>We are on a collective investigation. </p><p>How to create a celebratory space for conviviality and co-creation for the movement?</p><p><b></b><br></p><h2>Alt-Shift Association</h2><p>Alt-Shift is an association born from the degrowth movement. To be able to mount the project of the festival, we created the association: Alt-Shift. With this association we aim to create radical, embodied, holistic spaces: events, festivals,and also just content: all around the topic of degrowth. The festival idea is the first seed of the project, lets plant a forest. </p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Alt-Shift stands for alt-together, alt-ering, alternative and alt-rustic and is a space for holistic embodied and political knowledge generation. </p><p>A space that we can reclaim for the collective celebration of life. </p><p>A space where we can build an autonomous and caring community.</p><p><br></p><p><br></p><h2>Members</h2><p><br></p><p>Lara Stammen</p><p>My roots lie in the lower Rhine area in Germany, in a little village in which I grew up with my family. Alumna of the MA in Arts and Heritage at Maastricht University, I worked with XR in the Netherlands on art activism as transformative climate change communication. Currently I co-create a community based militant podcast as my end project for the MA Political Ecology at the Universitat Autonoma de Barcelona. For this podcast project, I moved to a community-based environmental education center in the South of Spain which is currently fulfilling me with a lot of passion for action towards local resiliences.</p><p><b><img></b></p><p>Tetiana Polatovska</p><p>I am Tati, I grew up in a small village of Northern Kyiv, currently living in Manchester, UK. I did an MA in Political Ecology, Degrowth and Environmental Justice in Barcelona and an MSc in Environmental Assessment and Management in Salford. My passion is to organize various educational events. Since 2019 I have organized Ecology Weeks for Ukrainian kids and two editions of Degrowth  Summer School in Barcelona. I love to engage in the topics of food sovereignty, socio-ecological justice and alternative ways of living.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Carlo Sella</p><p>I am a professional actor interested in the relationship between art and ecology. My formation includes different high formation courses in musical theatre, theatre of the senses and theatre for children. I hold a BSc in Business and Economics from the University of Bologna and am currently getting my Masters in Political Ecology and Degrowth at the Universidad Autonoma de Barcelona. My thesis is a theatre performance about environmental justice struggles related to waste disposal. I founded a theatre school for children in my home town, for which I work as a coordinator and educator. Now I am focusing on how to connect art to a just socio-ecological transition through workshops, performances and writings.</p><p><br></p><p>Lorenzo Velotti </p><p>I am currently a PhD candidate at the Faculty of Political and Social Sciences at the Scuola Normale Superiore and a member of Research and Degrowth (R&amp;D) and the Centre on Social Movement Studies (COSMOS). My research is on commons' movements and care, with an ethnographic approach, in Barcelona and Naples.I am holding a Msc in Anthropology and Development from the London School of Economics and Political Science and a bachelor's in Political, Social and International Sciences from the University of Bologna.</p><p>Since my masters', during which I researched degrowth social currencies in Catalunya, I came to see degrowth as a very powerful tool to envision a way out of present interrelated crises, as well as to connect different struggles for such socioecological transformation. In terms of research, I am particularly interested in degrowth from the point of view of economic anthropology, and am currently focusing on UBI.</p><p><b><br></b></p><p>Maxime Couette</p><p>I am a student in political ecology, degrowth and environmental justice from Lyon, France. Currently living in Paris, I am writing a masters thesis on well-being within planetary boundaries, while working as an educator on climate change issues at the Climate Fresk association. After co-organising a summer school on degrowth in 2021, I jumped into the Alt Shift Festival adventure in order to experiment a new way of connecting like-minded people and activists, while creating a space for radical education and experimentation.</p><p>Naomi Reinschmidt</p><p>I am a climate justice and food sovereignty activist, currently co-coordinating an austrian film festival about the right to food. I have been very lucky and got to live and study in Latin America for a little more than two years. There, through my experiences with places and people, their stories, and through my studies, I got the opportunity to become acquainted with and explore cosmovisions, worldviews, and thus approaches to life other than the one(s) I grew up with. As a social and cultural anthropologist, I temporarily laid a focus on the human-environment relationship, particularly looking at socio-ecological conflicts and underlying power relations. Due to an internal shift, I started to focus more on life affirming practices and philosophies rather than the deconstruction of dominant destructive patterns. This brought me to agroecology and a general focus on regenerative designs - my motivation-giving passion. I pursue to co-create and nurture narratives of "interbeing", so that a good life for all beings becomes possible.</p><p>Lisa Velema </p><p>Floating between Amsterdam and Rotterdam I did a dual bachelors in Arts and Cultural studies, and in Autonomous fine arts, with a minor in sustainability and Economics. Both my art research practice and academic interests have revolved around gentrification processes, urban commons and art activism. Currently working on a small opera that aims to give voice to women's anger in the wake of social injustices, and illustrating a frog and toad-themed tarot deck.</p><p><b></b><b></b><br><br></p><p><b></b><br><br></p>
